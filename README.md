# Volkswagen-i.mobilothon-4.0
# ServEase- VR Vehicle Maintenance System

The **VR vehicle maintenance System** is a prototype designed to visualize car parts and identify potential issues in a virtual environment. Currently, the project uses **Open3D** for 3D visualization as a proof of concept. The ultimate goal is to integrate full Virtual Reality (VR) capabilities for an immersive and interactive experience.
